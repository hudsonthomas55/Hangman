# Hangman
A classic childhood game of hangman


This program is a game I think every American child grew up playing. Essentially, it is a word guessing game which tells the user if their letter guessed is in the word, and if so it will replace the blank with the letter. Otherwise, it will take a life from the user.
This was an entire day's lesson from a Udemy class on Python with Dr. Angela Lu. I am quite proud of this project in that, I wrote most of the code myself, or at least had it working prior to her critique on how to streamline it.

Disclaimer:
I did not create the supplemental documents like the word list and art or flowchart.
